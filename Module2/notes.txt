PRACTICE QUIZ:
1. What is C#?
    A programming language for developing applications on the .NET framework

2. Which of the following statements is true about the readonly keyword in C#?

PRACTICE QUIZ:
1. Which of the following operators has the highest precedence in C#?

ARRAYS:

One-Dimensional Arrays
    Exemplo:
        int [] age;
        age = new int[5];

Multi-Dimensional Arrays
    Exemplo:
        int [,] age = new int[5, 5];

Jagged Arrays
    An array of arrays, where each sub-array can have DIFFERENT LENGTHS
    Exemplo:
        int[][] myArray = new int[3][];
        myArray[0] = new int[2] { 1, 2 };
        myArray[1] = new int[3] { 3, 4, 5 };
        myArray[2] = new int[4] { 6, 7, 8, 9 };
