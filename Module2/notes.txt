    studentName = "John Doe";
}

Parameterized Constructor

{
    studentID = id;
    studentName = name;
}

Os valores do Default Constructor são os valores padrão, enquanto os valores do Parameterized Constructor são passados como argumentos ao criar o objeto.

INHERITANCE:
    A mechanism by which one class can inherit the properties and methods of another class
    Allows for code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes

Single Inheritance
    A class can inherit from only one base class
Exemplo:
        class BaseClass
        {
            // Base class members
        }
        class DerivedClass : BaseClass
        {
            // Derived class members
        }

Multiple Inheritance
    A class can inherit from multiple base classes
    Not supported in C# directly, but can be achieved using interfaces
    Exemplo:
        interface IInterface1
        {
            // Interface members
        }
        interface IInterface2
        {
            // Interface members
        }
        class DerivedClass : IInterface1, IInterface2
        {
            // Derived class members
        }

Multilevel Inheritance
    A class can inherit from a base class, which in turn can inherit from another base class
    Exemplo:
        class BaseClass
        {
            // Base class members
        }
        class IntermediateClass : BaseClass
        {
            // Intermediate class members
        }
        class DerivedClass : IntermediateClass
        {
            // Derived class members
        }

Hierarchical Inheritance
    Multiple classes can inherit from a single base class
    Exemplo:
        class BaseClass
        {
            // Base class members
        }
        class DerivedClass1 : BaseClass
        {
            // Derived class 1 members
        }
        class DerivedClass2 : BaseClass
        {
            // Derived class 2 members
        }

Hybrid Inheritence
    A combination of multiple inheritance and hierarchical inheritance
    Not supported in C# directly, but can be achieved using interfaces
    Exemplo:
        interface IInterface1
        {
            // Interface members
        }
        interface IInterface2
        {
            // Interface members
        }
        class BaseClass
        {
            // Base class members
        }
        class DerivedClass1 : BaseClass, IInterface1
        {
            // Derived class 1 members
        }
        class DerivedClass2 : BaseClass, IInterface2
        {
            // Derived class 2 members
        }
    Não pode ser feito com classes, apenas com INTERFACES
